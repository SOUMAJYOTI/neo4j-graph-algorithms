= Harmonic Centrality

== TODO

Closely related to Closeness Centrality. Should lead to the same distribution of values but
should also be resistant to disconnected graphs.

== When to use it / use-cases

Like closeness centrality but on disconnected graphs

== Constraints / when not to use it

?

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph

We create a disconnected graph to show how we combat it

.Running algorithm and streaming results
[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/harmonic-centrality.cypher[tag=stream-sample-graph]
- yields centrality for each node

.Running algorithm and writing back results
[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/harmonic-centrality.cypher[tag=write-sample-graph]
- calculates closeness centrality and potentially writes back

Calculation:

k = N-1 = 4

     A     B     C     D     E
 ---|-----------------------------
 A  | 0     1     2     -     -    // distance between each pair of nodes
 B  | 1     0     1     -     -    // or infinite if no path exists
 C  | 2     1     0     -     -
 D  | -     -     -     0     1
 E  | -     -     -     1     0
 ---|------------------------------
 A  | 0     1    1/2    0     0    // inverse
 B  | 1     0     1     0     0
 C  |1/2    1     0     0     0
 D  | 0     0     0     0     1
 E  | 0     0     0     1     0

sum |1.5    2    1.5    1     1
 ---|------------------------------
 *k |0.37  0.5  0.37  0.25  0.25

instead of calculating the farness we sum the inverse
of each cell and multiply by 1/(n-1)

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Versions 

We support the following versions of the betweenness centrality algorithm:

* [*] directed, unweighted

* [ ] directed, weighted

* [*] undirected, unweighted

* [ ] undirected, weighted

== Implementation Details

...

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 inverseFarness(v) = inverseFarness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * (1/depth(v))
