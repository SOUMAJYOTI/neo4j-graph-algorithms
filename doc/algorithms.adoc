== Algorithms

=== PageRank



=== Development Notes

NOTE: When implementing a procedure that yields any results (is not `void`) and writes back to the database, make sure to consume the `Result` after running the algo call!

Algorithms are executed within a transaction, that is opened and closed by cypher. The transaction is only marked successful if the results are consumed.
Closing the Result directly will fail and rollback any open transactions and thus will revert all write-back operations.
// StandardInternalExecutionResult#successful is only set to true _after_ the result has been consumed
